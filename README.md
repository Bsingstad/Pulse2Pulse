## Pre-trained DeepFake ECG generator and it's funtionaltities - [GitHub (DeepFake ECG)](https://github.com/vlbthambawita/deepfake-ecg)

In this repository, we present how to train the Pulse2Pulse generative adversarial network which can generate DeepFake ECGs as discussed in our original paper. We maintain a seperate GitHub repository for generating random DeepFake ECGs from our pretrained model.
